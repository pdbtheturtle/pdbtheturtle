- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pdbtheturtle, My name is Illa and I'm on my way to become the best. I'm 18 years old russian student on 11th school grade. It's time to shine!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m really interested in programming, math, philosophy and sports.
- ðŸŒ³ I want to tell here about things that I have already learned, so there's the list of my skills: 
    - Python. I know all the syntax, operate confidently in it, I know how to use and include a number of standard libraries in programs.
    - HTML5, CSS3 and JS. I can build the layout without any problem, but if we're talking about the JS connection, it would be a little difficult, but anyway 
      I could do it.
    - Affection to math. I'm good in it, and if I need to figure out a new topic for me, it shouldn't be a big problem for me.
    - English. All the file was written by me with using my knowledges. Anyhow, you can find some mistakes here ;)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the ML basics and some Python frameworks and libraries, such as Django and python-telegram-bot. I also delve into the knowledge of standard libraries.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
    - Gmail: pdbtheturtle@gmail.com
    - Telegram: @pdbtheturtle
    - Codeforces: pdbtheturtle (but I usually is not active here)

Be happy, my friend.
